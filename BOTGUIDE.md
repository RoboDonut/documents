# Introduction to Bots

There are a couple of special bots present in the Spatial Community that are worth knowing about. This is a short guide to using them.

## Call Admin

If you want to send a message to the admin team, use this command. It will let them know what channel you have sent it from, along with a message why we should be looking at things.

Invoke it using `/call_admin {message}`. The admins will see something like `user: {your handle}, channel: {channel sent from}, message: {message}`.

Usually we will drop in on the channel and see what is going on. Depending on the situation, it will then be discussed between us and a decision as to what needs to happen will be made between the admin team.

## PointsBot

This bot awards extremely valuable internet points to people. There is no real criteria as to what a valid reason for giving points is, but they are usually used to thank people for giving advice.

Valid calls to this are the following:
`/points {@username} (user to give points to) {points} (points to give, -100 to +100) {reason} (optional)`
`/points me` (your score)
`/points top_5` (top 5 on the scoreboard)
`/points low_5` (low 5 on the scoreboard)
`/points givers` (top 5 givers scoreboard)
`/points takers` (top 5 takers scoreboard)

Awarding points to yourself is not allowed. Totals in excess of +-100 will be capped at +-100.

## Glob

If you want to search through all the channel names for something, this is what you want to use.

The command is invoked using `/glob {search pattern} {number}`.

## Poll

If you need a poll for some reason, this will allow you to create one.

Invoke it using `/poll {question} {option a} {option b} {so on}`.

## Memes

There are a series of commands that take little interaction. Most of them simply post a meme and/or gif of some kind.

`/deepthoughts` - Posts a random deep thought by Jack Handey. According to Wikipedia: "He is best known for his "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey", a large body of surrealistic one-liner jokes, as well as his "Fuzzy Memories" and "My Big Thick Novel" shorts, and for his deadpan delivery."
